# ** General Assembly WDI 37 - Project Two **

## **Honeypot**

Honeypot is a cyber security blogging platform made for the reader's **enjoyment**
by bringing content to the online community in an organised, easy to read format.

Honeypot is my second project, as a student undergoing General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.

## **Brief**

* **Have at least 2 models** â€“ one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of your app.
* **Include relationships** - embedded or referenced. Make sure you take the time to consider the best approach before building out your models.
* **The app should include authentication** - with encrypted passwords & an authorisation flow.
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with all CRUD actions.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense
rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.


## **Technologies Used**

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ECMAScript 6)
* Git
* GitHub
* EJS
* MongoDB
* NodeJS

## **Approach Taken**



## **Wins and Blockers**



## **Future Features**

* I would like to add moderation to my articles, so that the Administrator (me)
can read over articles and check whether they are appropriate, as well as fitting
the site's content.

* I would also like to add a complete Administration panel where the amount of users,
posts and comments can be tracked, as well as the possibility for the Administrator
to approve / decline posts, as well as comments.

* Encryption of passwords using Bcrypt is something that will be looked into and
implemented as one of the first updates to Honeypot.
